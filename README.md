# Birth-Rate-of-Singapore-Analysis
Analysis of the Birth Rate of Singapore

Problem Statement and Objectives

As most of us noticed the size of our respective households has decreased significantly across generations, and we find it interesting and relevant to explore this area. The issue of the low birth rate in Singapore has persisted for many years. In 2019, the country's total fertility rate dipped to an abysmal 1.14, putting Singapore at risk of under-population. Our report aims to examine the degree of significance of various factors such as increased education level, cost of living, work-life balance as well as child mortality rate.
